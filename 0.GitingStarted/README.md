Git revolves around several core data structures and commands:

- **Repository:** the data structure of your code, including a ``.git`` folder in the root directory [This folder is usually hidden. For example, this is a git project!]
- **Commit:** a particular saved state of the repository, which includes all files and additions
- **Branch:** a means of grouping a set of commits. Each branch has a unique history. This is primarily used for separating development and stable branches.
- **Push:** update the remote repository with your local changes
- **Pull:** update your local repository with the remote changes
- **Clone:** retrieve a local copy of a repository to modify
- **Fork:** duplicate a pre-existing repository to modify, and to compare against the original
- **Merge:** combine various changes from different branches/commits/forks into a single history
