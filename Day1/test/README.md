# Java Test
Finish this to earn your java badge! 

## Rules
* You may use resources normally available to you, so
  * You **can** use intellisense 
  * You **can** use Google
  * You **can** use Stack Overflow 
* But, you need to show a basic understanding. This means
  * You **cannot** use AI
  * You **cannot** use a tutorial (video or course)
* Yes the answer key is here if you look hard enough, but don't. Being here requires honesty.
* Try Your Best
## Testing
This project was designed with unit tests, i.e a way for developers to make sure a change doesn't 
break anything unexpected by testing all functionality before the new code can get too far. This 
means the code will test itself. Here are the possible ways to test the code:
* click the Wpilib icon (gear with a W) in the top right corner and select `Test Robot Code`
* Hit ctl+shift+p and type `Test Robot Code`

Whichever way you choose, the code will compile and run. Check the console to see the output.
If it says BUILD FAILED, then you still have work to do. If you want, you can scroll up and 
try to read why it failed, but you could also just ask for help.
